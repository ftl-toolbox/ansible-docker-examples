- name: "Set SELinux context properly"
  # In the future, someone wise can set this properly. 
  # For now, the following command doesn't work, so we'll
  # simply put SELinux into permissive mode.
  #
  # The point of the example is to show that, unlike
  # in a docker-compose file, you can set system 
  # attributes that are independent of Docker itself.
  # For any secure Enterprise Linux platform, setting
  # of SELinux context will be critical.
  # command: chcon -R system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 fig-elk/
